# TODO

- Add a sample file with multiple data sets and different dataSetActions: replace, delete, update.
- Change the "components" field to array so that the dimensions have an order. Update docs and samples.
- Look into annotations. Are they needed in the format? and if yes how should they be implemented?
- Look into linking to related SDMX structures (like the current "href" field in structure).
- Look into grouping fields in packaging into dimensions and attributes, e.g. packaging.dimensions.dataSet.
